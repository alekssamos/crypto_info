# The addon of crypto info for NVDA

[Home Page](https://github.com/alekssamos/crypto_info/)

### Keyboard shortcuts
* nvda+Alt+K - Show a list of cryptocurrencies
* nvda+Alt+0-9 - Listen to information about the selected cryptocurrency in the position from 0 to 9
> That is, nvda+Alt+0, nvda+Alt+1, nvda+Alt+2 and so on.

It can't be changed yet, maybe I'll do it soon. If it is inconvenient, change it through the Input Gestures.

In previous versions, information was taken from the page [Cryptocurrency Prices - Real Time Market Data - Investing.com](https://investing.com/crypto/),

but now they have restricted access and I have switched to [coincap.io](https://coincap.io/).
However, I did not find where they had changes in 7 days.
There is an opportunity to request historical data for as much as 11 years, but I'm not sure if this is it, and for the sake of getting one column, making a second request is such a thing.
